# Task Manager App

A full-stack Todo application built with React, TypeScript, and Deno.

## Acknowledgements
This project is based on starter code provided.

## What I Implemented
I have extended the starter project by completing the following work items:

### User Accounts & Login & Logout
- **Database:** Added a User structure/table using the ORM.
- **Frontend:** 
  - Implemented a login screen.
  - Implemented a Register user screen (Bonus).
  - Implemented redirection to the main screen (tasks) after successful login.
  - Added a **Logout** button to the main dashboard.
- **Backend:** 
  - Added corresponding backend routes (e.g., `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`).
  - Ensured login credentials are actively checked against the database.
